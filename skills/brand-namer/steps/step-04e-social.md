# Step 04e: Social Handles, Stress Tests & Extended Presence Check

**Progress:** Step 12 of 13 — Next: Final Presentation (step-04f)
**Reads:** `brand-namer-output/03-validation.md` | **Writes:** `brand-namer-output/03-validation.md` (update)

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- Read this COMPLETE file before taking any action
- FORBIDDEN to load next step until user selects [C] Continue
- FORBIDDEN to check social handles for all names — Tier 1 (Available & Clear) only
- FORBIDDEN to simulate System 1 gut reactions — the user's gut is the instrument, not the AI's
- Update artifact frontmatter `stepsCompleted` before loading next step
- After handling non-menu user input, ALWAYS re-display the current menu

## SUCCESS METRICS

- Social handles checked for Tier 1 names only (not wasting time on flagged names)
- Optional stress tests (Pre-Mortem, System 1/System 2) offered to user
- Extended presence check offered for top 1-3 finalists
- Generate-more checkpoint offered if pool feels thin after social checks

## FAILURE MODES

- CRITICAL: Checking social handles for all names instead of Tier 1 only
- CRITICAL: Not offering stress tests (Pre-Mortem, System 1/System 2) as options
- CRITICAL: AI attempting to simulate System 1 gut reactions instead of letting the user do it
- CRITICAL: Not offering extended presence check for finalists

## Execution

### Social handle check (Tier 1 names only)

For names that have reached Tier 1 (Available & Clear), do a final check on social media handle availability. This applies only to the strongest candidates — don't waste time checking names that have already been flagged.

Search for handle availability on the platforms most relevant to the brand:
- **Twitter/X** — search `x.com/[name]` or `twitter.com/[name]`
- **Instagram** — search `instagram.com/[name]`
- **LinkedIn** — search for company pages with the name
- **TikTok** — if relevant to the brand's audience

Note for each: available, taken by an inactive/unrelated account, or actively in use. A name with a clean sweep across domain + social handles is significantly more valuable.

### Checkpoint: generate more?

After social handle results, if the final pool feels thin or the user isn't excited about any survivors: "We have [N] names with clean availability across domains and social handles. Want to move to final presentation, or generate one more round?" Same loop-back options. Only run the full validation chain (4a+4b+4d+4e) on new names — check the validation log.

### Optional: Pre-Mortem Stress Test

Before final presentation, consider running a **Pre-Mortem Analysis** (see `references/elicitation-techniques.md`) on the top 3-5 candidates. For each: imagine it's 18 months post-launch and the name has caused problems — what went wrong? This surfaces risks that optimism hides. Offer this to the user: "Want me to stress-test these finalists before presenting?"

### Optional: System 1 / System 2 name testing (user-driven)

This exercise must be driven by the user, not the AI. LLMs can only do analytical evaluation (System 2) — they cannot simulate the pre-cognitive, millisecond-level gut reactions that determine how a name actually lands in the real world. The user's gut is the instrument here.

Offer this to the user for the top 3-5 finalists:

"Before we finalize, I'd like to run a quick two-speed test on your finalists. This is based on Daniel Kahneman's System 1/System 2 framework — most name testing only measures analytical thinking, but real-world name encounters happen in split seconds.

**Round 1 — System 1 (gut recall):** Present all finalist names together as a simple list — no rationale, no context, just the names. Then ask:
- 'Which name did your eye land on first?'
- 'Which one made you flinch or feel resistance?'
- 'Which one are you most curious about?'
- 'Which one feels forgettable?'
The user already had gut reactions when they saw the list — these questions surface those reactions before analytical thinking overwrites them.

**Round 2 — System 2 (analytical, take your time):** Now go back through the same names one at a time and evaluate them deliberately: what does this name communicate? What story does it tell? What are its strengths and weaknesses?

**Then we compare:** If a name scores well analytically but triggered a negative gut reaction, the gut usually wins in the real world — customers won't stop to analyze your name, they'll just react. If a name triggered a positive gut reaction but has analytical weaknesses, that's worth investigating — the emotional pull might outweigh the logical objections. The strongest finalists are names where both systems agree."

Record the results in `03-validation.md`. Divergence between System 1 and System 2 scores is a meaningful signal — flag it in the final presentation.

### Extended presence check (offer on final 1-3 only)

For the top 1-3 finalists, offer to check broader digital presence:
- **App stores:** Apple App Store, Google Play — is the name taken by an existing app?
- **Search results:** Google "[name]" — how crowded are the results? Would this brand struggle to rank?
- **Business registries:** Is there an LLC or corporation with this name in the user's target state/country?

"Want me to do a deeper digital presence check on your top picks before we finalize?"

## Menu

- **[P]** Pre-Mortem — stress test top 3-5 candidates
- **[T]** Two-Speed Test — System 1/System 2 evaluation
- **[X]** Extended check — deeper digital presence on top 1-3
- **[G]** Generate more — one more round if pool is thin
- **[C]** Continue — proceed to Final Presentation (Step 13 of 13)

**My recommendation:** If you have strong finalists you're excited about, run [P] Pre-Mortem to catch hidden risks, then [T] Two-Speed Test to validate gut alignment. These optional tests take 5-10 minutes and frequently change the final ranking. If the pool feels thin or uninspiring, use [G] first.

**HALT — wait for user selection before proceeding.**

IF user provides non-menu input: Respond helpfully, then re-display this menu.
IF [P]: Run Pre-Mortem on top 3-5, record results in `03-validation.md`, then re-display this menu.
IF [T]: Run System 1/System 2 test (user-driven), record results in `03-validation.md`, then re-display this menu.
IF [X]: Run extended presence check on top 1-3, record results in `03-validation.md`, then re-display this menu.
IF [G]: Loop back to generation, re-validate new names through full chain (4a+4b+4d+4e), then re-display this menu.
IF [C]: Update `03-validation.md` frontmatter `stepsCompleted`, load next step (`steps/step-04f-final.md`).

## Master Rule

Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, auto-advancing past menus, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
